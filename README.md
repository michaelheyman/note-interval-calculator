## Requirements

[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/):

- The Haskell tool stack
- Install with homebrew: `brew install stack`

## Testing

Tests are located in the [test](./test) directory. You may choose to run:

- Directly with `stack`:

    ```bash
    stack test
    ```

- Interactively with `stack`, followed by running `main` in GHCi:

    ```bash
    stack ghci note-interval-calculator:note-interval-calculator-test
    # Î»> main
    ```

- Compiling and reloading tests continuously:

    ```bash
    ghcid --command="stack ghci note-interval-calculator:note-interval-calculator-test"
    ```
